Wolff is a ridiculously small and lightweight PHP framework, intended for those who want to build web apps without dealing with complexity. 

Wolff is the perfect solution for building small and medium-sized web applications.

> **Note:** The core code of the framework is available at [Wolff-framework](https://github.com/usbac/wolff-framework).

## Features

üìì **Extremely easy**: It's simple to use and no initial setup is required, it comes ready to be deployed, giving you the opportunity to learn it in just a single night (sleep included).

üöÄ **Ridiculously fast**: Only the resources you need are loaded, the framework is able to handle hundreds of requests per second. It's very friendly with potato servers and works seamlessly.

üõ†Ô∏è **Comprenhensive**: Wolff has features that cover everything you may ever need for building a web app, from a handy database abstraction to a powerful template engine.
