Wolff is a ridiculously small and lightweight PHP framework, intended for those who want to build web apps without dealing with complexity. 

Wolff is the perfect solution for building small and medium-sized web applications.

> **Note:** The core code of the framework is available at [Wolff-framework](https://github.com/usbac/wolff-framework).

## Features

üìì **Extremely easy**: It's simple to use and comes ready to be deployed, giving you the opportunity to learn it in just a single night (sleep included).

üöÄ **Ridiculously fast**: Due to its simplicity, the framework is able to handle hundreds of requests per second. It's very friendly with potato servers.

üõ†Ô∏è **Comprenhensive**: It has everything you may need for building a web app, from a handy database abstraction layer to a dynamic template engine.

ü¶Ñ **Elegant**: Its source code and interface has been meticulously written, it's expressive and elegant, without depending on a single external dependency.
